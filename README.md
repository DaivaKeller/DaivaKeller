"Carpe Diem" is the right decision for anyone who wants to expand their professional skills and knowledge. I am a physics graduate who decided to enter the IT world with the goal of learning more about modern technologies.

My last project helped me learn more about website structure, CSS, React, UseEffect, StateEffect, and other frontend technologies. I also gained some initial insights into backend technologies.

I am looking forward to further expanding my knowledge and skills in a broader spectrum of the IT world, so that it could lead to cooperative work on interesting projects.
